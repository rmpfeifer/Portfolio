    <h1><strong><b>MAME Arcade</b></strong></h1>
    <div class="splashsmall">
      <p>
        The idea for making an arcade cabinet came from my uncle. My family went to go visit them for the Fourth of July
        because they lived in a county where fireworks were legal. He showed me an arcade cabinet in his basement that
        he had bought and I thought it was just the coolest thing. He had maybe a hundred or so old arcade games loaded
        onto it, although not all of them ran correctly.<br><br>

        When I went home I almost immediately bought a nice set of chrome buttons, joysticks, and raspberry pi to run
        the cabinet with. Researching diffrent ways to set it all up, it became clear that <a
          href="https://retropie.org.uk/" class="contact" style="color: #910000;"><b>Retropie</b></a> was eaisly the
        best option. It could emulate all sorts of old consoles but I was more intrested in it's MAME support. MAME, or
        Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator, is what emulates the old arcade cabinets from the eighties. MAME is
        complicated to set up but Retropie completely handled everything so in the end it was no harder than flashing
        Retropie to the raspberry pi's boot ssd. <br><br>

        Adding the speakers were easy enough- a pair of 3" speakers and a small amp were plenty loud. The power button
        was a bit more of a challenge. I had no idea how to setup a button that could not only turn the pi off, but also
        back on again. Most of the guides I could find only covered shutting down. Eventually I found one that worked
        for me, and the electronics were done! All that was left was the cabinet itself! <br><br>

        Unfortunately, because lumber prices were beginning to skyrocket due to covid, the project was put on the
        backburner until prices came back down. Thankfully they did drop eventually, and we went and got our wood.
        Because this was a replica cabinet we wanted to build it out of 3/4" MDF so we grabbed two 4x8' sheets and
        immediately regretted our decision. Fun fact: one 4x8' sheet of MDF is about 90 pounds, and we had two.
        Thankfully we didn't use it all when building the cabinet so after we finished, it was only around 150 pounds
        total. After finding a nice vinyl wrap for the cabinet it was all done!
