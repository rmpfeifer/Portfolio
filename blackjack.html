    <h3><b>Javascript blackjack</b></h3>
    <div class="splashsmall">
      <p>
        Online blackjack! For the final for my programming II class, I chose to make blackjack! As this was a javascript class, nearly everything is controlled with javascript. The html is mostly just there to explain the rules, provide the canvas for javascript to draw on, and provide overall structure.<br><br>

        Because I wanted to draw the cards with javascript, this became very difficult. The code for drawing one number on a card wasn't the shortest, and before I knew it I was getting sloppy. There were about 400 lines of code for this project, and im sure if I went back in today I could half that number. But I want to keep it in it's original state from when I submitted it for my final project.<br><br>
