    <h3><b>A website for Fused Legions</b></h3>
    <div class="splashsmall">
      <p>
        For my web development class, our final project was simply to make a website. I chose to make a new website for a gaming clan I was a part of called Fused Legions. Our old one was able to direct people to our discord and steam group, but nothing else. It looked bad, and was in desperate need of a refresh. My website took inspiration from other squad clans while still retaining its true purpose- Directing people to our discord.<br><br>

        Not only was the first website I ever designed, but it would also be used by potentially hundreds of players! At our peak we had 500 people playing squad on our server hardware, so I really tried to make sure the website worked! Looking back on it the website has a number of issues, and it never went live because the clan disbanded due to the declining popularity of squad.<br><br>
