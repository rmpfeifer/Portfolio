        Our big project in Studio III! The historical society & museum for nearby Clay County wanted us to design a page for their site where visitors could search through land records dating back to the homestead act. These visitors could search for their name and see where their family might have once lived. <br><br>

        The entire class split into groups and we each made our own prototype. At the end of the semester we all presented what we had made while the curator gave feedback about what he did and didn't like, so next semester whoever picked up the torch could merge them all together. As this was a group project, my role was helping to set up the database and querying it when the user tried to search something.<br><br>
