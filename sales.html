    <h3><b>Using python to sell games</b></h3>

      <p>
        The final for one of my mlas classes, the purpose of this project was to find a large dataset and make some sense out of it. I wanted work on something I find intresting, so I got a list of over 50,000 games and how they sold. Using several python libraries such as seaborn and pandas, I found what attributes such as genre and esrb rating a game should have to maximise global sales.<br><br>

        Cleaning up the dataset proved to be a massive hassle. So many of the records had missing or wrong data so after filtering them out, some columns had to be dropped entirely! Cleaning up the data was a challenge, but once it was done it turned out great.<br><br>
