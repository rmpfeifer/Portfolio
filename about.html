      <p id="aboutp">
        I have always had a love for computers from the day I got my first one! It was nothing special, just some old
        brick leaving an office building, but it was so cool messing with it. I would take it apart and try to put it
        back together, usually breaking somthing in the process. Unfortunately it didn't last long before I fried it. It
        kicked off my love for computers, and I decided early on that this was want I wanted to do when I grew
        up.<br><br>

        Ultimately my love for creating/messing with stuff has got me here. I enjoy playing and modding games, 3d
        printing, and have even done some woodworking. One of the projects not listed in my portfolio was a hexagonal
        gaming table, perfect for playing Catan on!<br><br>

        Now I am a student at K-State Salina, studying machine learning & autonomous systems. I currently work in their
        IT department where I help help solve people's computer related issues. While taking classes here, I learned
        that I enjoy solving issues with a variety of technologies like javascript and python.

      <p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns I would love to hear them! <br></p>
