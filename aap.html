        The Association of Airworthiness Professionals, a nonprofit focused on promoting airworthiness in industry, was in desperate need of a new website. Their old one was unresponsive and several pages on the website nav bar simply didn't exist if you tried to go to them. A project for my web development class, I was assigned to a group to work on their new website. <br><br>

        The result is a beautiful and modern website that works great. We are still working on it as I write this blurb, so nothing is final yet. My role in the group was going to be helping setup the login system using their host, but it has been decided they should probably move to a new host. Who that will be is still up in the air, and probably will not happen in time before the class ends, so instead I am helping with various smaller tasks whenever I can.  <br><br>
