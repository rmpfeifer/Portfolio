    <h1><strong><b>I am an Eagle Scout</b></strong></h1>

      <p>
        I started scouting in 5th grade, and loved it from the start. My dad had already put my brother through scouting
        and signed me up because he thought I would enjoy it. He was right! Going camping and learning all sorts of cool
        things about nature was a nice break from going to school and playing games. The best part was learning about
        things my mom didn't trust me with, like knife saftey and firestarting.<br><br>
        Over time scouting went from having fun goofing off to getting serious and learning important things. I learned
        the basics of first aid, how to do CPR, and wilderness survival. I got elected to be our troop quartermaster,
        where I was in charge of the logistics of anything the troop did. I went from basic knowledge of first aid to
        learning emergency techniques such as applying tourniquets. Before I knew it, my friends and I had become the
        troop leadership, helping the younger kids advance. After years of hard work, six of us made it to the rank of
        Eagle.

      <h2>
        Eagle Project
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to become an eagle scout, you need to complete an eagle project. I chose to help a daycare near my
        house, The Holy Trinity daycare, and see if they had anything I could do. They wanted me to build a slide for
        the younger kids who were not old enough to use the main playground. After doing some planning, we decided to
        convert an old garden plot into this slide. While it initially seemed simple enough- just pile some dirt up and
        put a slide on top, it was nowhere near that simple. It used two tonnes of dirt, and took 2 days to build even
        with a full crew of 7 boys helping. The end result is a beautiful slide that the younger kids can use and the
        grounds crew there can eaisly maintain.
